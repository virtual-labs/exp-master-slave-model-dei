      "explanations": {
        "a": "SDA is the data line, not the clock line.",
        "b": "SCL is the clock line, responsible for synchronizing communication between the master and slave.",
        "c": "VCC is the power line, not involved in data transfer.",
        "d": "GND is the ground line, not involved in data transfer."

      "question": "What happens if two I2C devices are assigned the same address?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The communication will proceed normally",
        "b": "Data will be corrupted or lost",
        "c": "Only the first device will respond",
        "d": "The master will reset the bus"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Devices with the same address will cause a conflict, not normal communication.",
        "b": "When two devices have the same address, data corruption or loss can occur.",
        "c": "The master device will not know which slave to communicate with, causing a conflict.",
        "d": "The master will not reset the bus in case of an address conflict."
