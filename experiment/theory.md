Theory :

The Arduino Master-Slave model refers to an experimental setup utilizing Arduino microcontrollers to establish a communication network between multiple devices. The concept of a master-slave relationship in this context involves one Arduino board, known as the master, controlling and coordinating the operations of one or more Arduino boards, referred to as slaves.

The experiment begins by connecting the Arduino master and slave boards using a suitable communication protocol, such as I2C or Serial. The master board assumes the role of the central controller, sending instructions and receiving data from the slave boards. The slave boards, on the other hand, act as peripheral devices that execute commands from the master and provide relevant information when requested.
