        "a": "Slaves only respond to the master's requests, they do not initiate communication.",

      "question": "What is the role of the slave device in the I2C master-slave communication?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To initiate data transfer",
        "b": "To respond to masterâ€™s requests",
        "c": "To control the clock signal",
        "d": "To generate the address of the bus"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The slave does not initiate data transfer; it responds to the master's commands.",
        "b": "The slave device responds to the master's requests for data or commands.",
        "c": "The clock signal is generated by the master, not the slave.",
        "d": "The master assigns addresses to the slaves in I2C communication."
